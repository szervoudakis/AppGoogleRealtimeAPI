# AppGoogleRealtimeAPI
Study of Google Realtime API and its possible applications in collaborative environments (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON) 
we focused on Google's Realtime API study 
and the analysis of the opportunities 
it offers for the development of cooperative applications.
The approach adopted was to develop an application tha 
will use the Google Realtime API in order to provide 
new services to users of an existing platform. 
For this purpose the Trello platform was selected , 
a widespread online collaborative project implementation service. 
The detrimental purpose of the application developed is to get 
data from Trello and with the help of Realtime API to 
create new information opportunities 
(for the members involved in the application) 
as well as new communication 
possibilities among the 
partners of the application. 
Let us note here that our goal was 
primarily to support information and communication functions 
of partners that are not supported by the Trello platform 
itself. A secondary objective was to support basic operations
already in place mainly for confirmation purposes 
(that is, there is communication between the two web 
applications Trello and the application developed).
